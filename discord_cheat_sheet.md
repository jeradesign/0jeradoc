Hey Folks! When you're making your event, Discord has a cool feature that lets you display dates that automatically convert for whoever's reading it!

To use this exciting feature, you have to convert the event to Unix Time. What is Unix Time you ask? It's the number of seconds since 1970 started (in UTC). Any more than that, you can look up yourself üòâ

Step 1. Pick a date and time for your event.
Step 2.Find a "Unix Time Converter" -  this one works perfectly well https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php
Step 3: Take your big string of numbers (Hint, 2022 in Unix Time is 1640995200, if your number is less than this, it's in the past) and copy it
Step 4: Come back to discord and type <t: and then paste your numbers, then type >, then press enter! (Or continue your message). 

And you're done!

I do recommend a Step 5: add a "this date is already in your native time zone!" message at the end, because Discord does not make this clear.

For example:
New Year's Day, 2022, GMT - December 31, 2021 4:00 PM 

There are some extra features to this command, which you can read up on by looking it (I can't find an official help page for it!).
